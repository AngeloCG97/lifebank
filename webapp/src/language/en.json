      "weIdentified": "We identified two main problems: a blood donation shortage and a local economic slowdown. Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, blood banks urgently need donors. People who are potential qualifying donors are prompted to stay home and isolate. As donations plummet and demand for blood and plasma increases, blood banks are experiencing a pronounced global shortage.",
      "moreOver": "Moreover, the pandemic is impacting local economies due to a generalized lockdown. Small businesses that rely on the local community must think of ways to incentivize customers to buy as soon as restrictions are lifted.",
      "aDonorCanEarn": "A donor can earn life tokens after completing a blood donation at a Lifebank participating donation center. Donation centers can issue a maximum of 10,000 life tokens. These tokens can then be redeemed by the donor at any local business (or sponsor) in exchange for discounts or promotions.",
      "also": "Also, sponsors can save these tokens and then return them to donation centers to keep the tokens active."
